<p>Inspection is used to populate hardware information in the BareMetalHost
objects. You can <a href="https://book.metal3.io/bmo/external_inspection">disable it</a>,
but you may need to populate this information yourself. Do not blindly
disable inspection if it fails - chances are high the subsequent
operations fail the same way.</p>
