<p>IPMI is the acronym for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Intelligent Platform Management Interface</code>
which is used to monitor hardware health (fans, voltage, temperature,
etc). The specification is available at

and was created by a joint effort by several manufacturers. It allows us
