    "body": "Renaming of Cluster API provider: Backwards compatibility for v1alpha3 There is no backwards compatibility between v1alpha3 and v1alpha2 releases ofthe Cluster API provider for Metal3. For the v1alpha3 release of Cluster API, the Metal3 provider was renamed fromcluster-api-provider-baremetal to cluster-api-provider-metal3. The CustomResource Definitions were also modified. This post dives into the changes. Repository renaming: From v1alpha3 onwards, the Cluster API provider will be developed incluster-api-provider-metal3. The v1alpha1 and v1alpha2 content will remain incluster-api-provider-baremetal. This repository will be archived, but kept for the integration in metal3-dev-env. Custom Resource Definition modifications: The kind of the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) has been modified for thefollowing objects:  BareMetalCluster to Metal3Cluster baremetalcluster to metal3cluster BareMetalMachine to Metal3Machine baremetalmachine to metal3machine BareMetalMachineTemplate to Metal3MachineTemplate baremetalmachinetemplate to metal3machinetemplateThe custom resources deployed need to be modified accordingly. Deployment modifications: The prefix of all deployed components for the Metal3 provider was modifiedfrom capbm- to capm3-. The namespace in which the components are deployed bydefault was modified from capbm-system to capm3-system. "

    "body": "Conference talk: Metal³: Kubernetes Native Bare Metal Cluster Management - Maël Kimmerlin: On the 20th of January at the Kubernetes and CNCF Finland Meetup, Maël Kimmerlin gave a brilliant presentation about the status of the Metal³ project. In this presentation, Maël starts giving a short introduction of the Cluster API project which provides a solid foundation to develop the Metal³ Bare Metal Operator (BMO). The talk basically focuses on the v1alpha2 infrastructure provider features from the Cluster API. Information The video recording from the “Kubernetes and CNFC Finland Meetup” is composed by three talks. The video embedded starts with Maël’s talk. Warning Playback of the video has been disabled by the author. Click on play button and then on “Watch this video on Youtube” link once it appears.  During the first part of the presentation, a detailed explanation of the different Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) inside Metal³ is shown and also how they are linked with the Cluster API project. As an example, the image below shows the interaction between objects and controllers from both projects: Once finished the introductory part, Maël focuses on the main components of the Metal³ BMO and the provisioning process. This process starts with introspection, where the bare metal server is registered by the operator. Then, the Ironic Python Agent (IPA) image is executed to collect all hardware information from the server.  The second part of the process is the provisioning. In this step, Maël explains how the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) is in charge along with Ironic to present the Operating System image to the physical server and complete its installation.  Next, Maël deeply explains each Custom Resource (CR) used during the provisioning of target Kubernetes clusters in bare metal servers. He refers to objects such as Cluster, BareMetalCluster, Machine, BareMetalMachine, BareMetalHost and so on. Each one is clarified with a YAML file definition of a real case and a workflow diagram that shows the reconciliation procedure. Last part of the talk is dedicated to execute a demo where Maël creates a target Kubernetes cluster from a running minikube VM (also called bootstrap cluster) where Metal³ is deployed. As it is pointed out in the video, the demo is running in emulated hardware. Actually, something similar to the metal3-dev-env project which can be used to reproduce the demo. More information of the Metal³ development environment (metal3-dev-env) can be found in the Metal³ try-it section. In case you want to go deeper, take a look at the blog post A detailed walkthrough of the Metal³ development environment. At the end, the result is a new Kubernetes cluster up and running. The cluster is deployed on two emulated physical servers: one runs as the control-plane node and the other as a worker node. Information The slides of the talk can be downloaded from here Speakers: Maël Kimmerlin Maël Kimmerlin is a Senior Software Engineer at Ericsson. In his own words: I am an open-source enthusiast, focusing in Ericsson on Life Cycle Management of Kubernetes clusters on Bare Metal. I am very interested in the Cluster API project from the Kubernetes Lifecycle SIG, and active in its Bare Metal provider, that is Metal³, developing and encouraging the adoption of this project.

    "body": "Introduction to metal3-dev-env: metal3-dev-env is a collection of scripts in a Github repository inside the Metal³ project that aims to allow contributors and other interested users to run a fully functional Metal³ environment for testing and have a first contact with the project. Actually, metal3-dev-env sets up an emulated environment which creates a set of virtual machines (VMs) to manage as if they were bare metal hosts. Warning This is not an installation that is supposed to be run in production. Instead, it is focused on providing a development environment to test and validate new features. The metal3-dev-env repository includes a set of scripts, libraries and resources used to set up a Metal³ development environment. On the Metal³ website there is already a documented process on how to use the metal3-dev-env scripts to set up a fully functional cluster to test the functionality of the Metal³ components. This procedure at 10,000 foot view is composed by 3 bash scripts plus a verification one:  01_prepare_host. sh - Mainly installs all needed packages.  02_configure_host. sh - Basically create a set of VMs that will be managed as if they were bare metal hosts. It also downloads some images needed for Ironic.  03_launch_mgmt_cluster. sh - Launches a management cluster using minikube and runs the baremetal-operator on that cluster.  04_verify. sh - Finally runs a set of tests that verify that the deployment completed successfullyIn this blog post we are going to expand the information and provide some hints and recommendations. Warning Metal³ project is changing rapidly, so probably this information is valuable in the short term. In any case, it is encouraged to double check that the information provided is still valid. Before get down to it, it is worth defining the nomenclature used along the blog post:  Host. It is the server where the virtual environment is running. In this case it is a physical PowerEdge M520 with 2 x Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2450 v2 @ 2. 50GHz, 96GB RAM and a 140GB drive running CentOS 7 latest. Do not panic, lab environment should work with lower resources as well.  Virtual bare metal hosts. These are the virtual machines (KVM based) that are running on the host which are emulating physical hosts in our lab. They are also called bare metal hosts even if they are not physical servers.  Management or bootstrap cluster. It is a fully functional Kubernetes cluster in charge of running all the necessary Metal³ operators and controllers to manage the infrastructure. In this case it is the minikube virtual machine.  Target cluster. It is the Kubernetes cluster created from the management one. It is provisioned and configured using a native Kubernetes API for that purpose. Create the Metal³ laboratory: Information A non-root user must exist in the host with passwordless sudo access. This user is in charge of running the metal3-dev-env scripts. First thing that needs to be done is, obviously, cloning the metal3-dev-env repository: [alosadag@eko1: ~]$ git clone https://github. com/metal3-io/metal3-dev-env. gitCloning into 'metal3-dev-env'. . . remote: Enumerating objects: 22, done. remote: Counting objects: 100% (22/22), done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (22/22), done. remote: Total 1660 (delta 8), reused 8 (delta 0), pack-reused 1638Receiving objects: 100% (1660/1660), 446. 08 KiB | 678. 00 KiB/s, done. Resolving deltas: 100% (870/870), done. Before starting to deploy the Metal³ environment, it makes sense to detail a series of scripts inside the library folder that will be sourced in every step of the installation process. They are called shared libraries. [alosadag@eko1:~]$ ls -1 metal3-dev-env/lib/common. shimages. shlogging. shnetwork. shShared libraries: Although there are several scripts placed inside the lib folder that are sourced in some of the deployment steps, common. sh and logging. sh are the only ones used in all of the executions during the installation process. common. sh: The first time this library is run, a new configuration file is created with several variables along with their default values. They will be used during the installation process. On the other hand, if the file already exists, then it just sources the values configured. The configuration file is created inside the cloned folder with config_$USER as file name. [alosadag@eko1 metal3-dev-env]$  ls config_*config_alosadag. shThe configuration file contains multiple variables that will be used during the set up. Some of them are detailed in the setup section of the Metal³ try-it web page. In case you need to add or change global variables it should be done in this config file. Note I personally recommend modify or add variables in this config file instead of exporting them in the shell. By doing that, it is assured that they are persisted [alosadag@eko1 metal3-dev-env]$ cat ~/metal3-dev-env/config_alosadag. sh#!/bin/bash## This is the subnet used on the  baremetal  libvirt network, created as the# primary network interface for the virtual bare metalhosts. ## Default of 192. 168. 111. 0/24 set in lib/common. sh##export EXTERNAL_SUBNET= 192. 168. 111. 0/24 ## This SSH key will be automatically injected into the provisioned host# by the provision_host. sh script. ## Default of ~/. ssh/id_rsa. pub is set in lib/common. sh##export SSH_PUB_KEY=~/. ssh/id_rsa. pub. . . The common. sh library also makes sure there is an ssh public key available in the user’s ssh folder. This key will be injected by cloud-init in all the virtual bare metal machines that will be configured later. Then, the user that executed the metal3-dev-env scripts is able to access the target cluster through ssh. This common. sh library also sets more global variables apart from the those in the config file. Note that these variables can be added to the config file along with the proper values for your environment.

If there is any issue during the deployment, this is one of the first places to look at. [alosadag@eko1 metal3-dev-env]$ ls -1 logs/01_prepare_host-2020-02-03-122452. log01_prepare_host-2020-02-03-122956. loghost_cleanup-2020-02-03-122656. logFirst step: Prepare the host: In this first step (01_prepare_host. sh), the requirements needed to start the preparation of the host where the virtual bare metal hosts will run are fulfilled. Depending on the host’s operating system (OS), it will trigger a specific script for CentOS/Red Hat or Ubuntu.  note: “Note”Currently CentOS Linux 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and Ubuntu have been tested. There is work in progress to adapt the deployment for CentOS Linux 8. As stated previously, CentOS 7 is the operating system chosen to run in both, the host and virtual servers. Therefore, specific packages of the operating system are applied in the following script:    centos_install_requirements. sh  This script enables the epel and tripleo (current-tripleo) repositories where several packages are installed: dnf, ansible, wget, python3 and python related packages such as python-virtualbmc from tripleo repository. Note Notice that SELinux is set to permissive and an OS update is triggered, which will cause several packages to be upgraded since there are newer packages in the tripleo repositories (mostly python related) than in the rest of enabled repositories. At this point, the container runtime is also installed. Note that by setting the variable CONTAINER_RUNTIME defined in common. sh is possible to choose between docker and podman, which is the default for CentOS. Remember that this behaviour can be overwriten in your config file. Once the specific requirements for the elected operating system are accomplished, the download of several external artifacts is executed. Actually minikube, kubectl and kustomize are downloaded from the internet. Notice that the version of Kustomize and Kubernetes are defined by KUSTOMIZE_VERSION and KUBERNETES_VERSION variables inside common. sh, but minikube is always downloading the latest version available. Next step deals with cleaning ironic containers and pods that could be running in the host from failed deployments. This will ensure that there will be no issues when creating ironic-pod and infra-pod a little bit later in this first step.    network. sh.   At this point, the network library script is sourced. As expected, this library deals with the network configuration which includes: IP addresses, network definitions and IPv6 support which is disabled by default by setting PROVISIONING_IPV6 variable:             Name of the variable    Default value    Option          PROVISIONING_NETWORK    172. 22. 0. 0/24    This is the subnet used to run the OS provisioning process          EXTERNAL_SUBNET    192. 168. 111. 0/24    This is the subnet used on the “baremetal” libvirt network, created as the primary network interface for the virtual bare metal hosts          LIBVIRT_FIRMWARE    bios               PROVISIONING_IPV6    false            Below it is depicted a network diagram of the different virtual networks and virtual servers involved in the Metal³ environment:    images. sh.   The images. sh library file is sourced as well in the 01_prepare_host. sh script . The images. sh script contains multiple variables that set the URL (IMAGE_LOCATION), name (IMAGE_NAME) and default username (IMAGE_USERNAME) of the cloud image that needs to be downloaded. The values of each variable will differ depending on the operating system of the virtual bare metal hosts. Note that these images will be served from the host to the virtual servers through the provisioning network.  In our case, since CentOS 7 is the base operating system, values will be defined as:             Name of the variable    Default value          IMAGE_NAME    CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud-1907. qcow2          IMAGE_LOCATION    http://cloud. centos. org/centos/7/images          IMAGE USERNAME    centos      Information In case it is expected to use a custom cloud image, just modify the previous variables to match the right location. Now that the cloud image is defined, the download process can be started. First, a folder defined by IRONIC_IMAGE_DIR should exist so that the image (CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud-1907. qcow2) and its checksum can be stored. This folder and its content will be exposed through a local ironic container running in the host.       Name of the variable   Default value       IRONIC_IMAGE_DIR   /opt/metal3-dev-env/ironic/html/images   Below it is verified that the cloud image files were downloaded successfully in the defined folder: [alosadag@eko1 metal3-dev-env]$ ll /opt/metal3-dev-env/ironic/html/imagestotal 920324-rw-rw-r--. 1 alosadag alosadag 942407680 Feb  3 12:39 CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud-1907. qcow2-rw-rw-r--. 1 alosadag alosadag        33 Feb 3 12:39 CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud-1907. qcow2. md5sumOnce the images. sh shared script is sourced, the following container images are pre-cached locally to the host in order to speed up things later. Below it is shown the code snippet in charge of that task: + for IMAGE_VAR in IRONIC_IMAGE IPA_DOWNLOADER_IMAGE VBMC_IMAGE SUSHY_TOOLS_IMAGE DOCKER_REGISTRY_IMAGE+ IMAGE=quay. io/metal3-io/ironic+ sudo podman pull quay. io/metal3-io/ironic. . . . . . . The container image location of each one is defined by their respective variables:       Name of the variable   Default value       VBMC_IMAGE   quay. io/metal3-io/vbmc       SUSHY_TOOLS_IMAGE   quay. io/metal3-io/sushy-tools       IPA_DOWNLOADER_IMAGE   quay. io/metal3-io/ironic-ipa-downloader       IRONIC_IMAGE   quay. io/metal3-io/ironic       DOCKER_REGISTRY_IMAGE   docker. io/registry:latest   Information In case it is expected to modify the public container images to test new features, it is worth mentioning that there is a container registry running as a privileged container in the host. Therefore it is recommended to upload your modified images there and just overwrite the previous variables to match the right location. At this point, an Ansible role is run locally in order to complete the local configuration. ansible-playbook \ -e  working_dir=$WORKING_DIR  \ -e  virthost=$HOSTNAME  \ -i vm-setup/inventory. ini \ -b -vvv vm-setup/install-package-playbook. ymlThis playbook imports two roles. One called packages_installation, which is in charge of installing a few more packages. The list of packages installed are listed as default Ansible variables in the vm-setup role inside the metal3-dev-env repository. The other role is based on the fubarhouse. golang Ansible Galaxy role. It is in charge of installing and configuring the exact golang version 1. 12. 12 defined in an Ansible variable in the install-package-playbook. yml playbook Once the playbook is finished, a pod called ironic-pod is created. Inside that pod, a privileged ironic-ipa-downloader container is started and attached to the host network. This container is in charge of downloading the Ironic Python Agent (IPA) files to a shared volume defined by IRONIC_IMAGE_DIR. This folder is exposed by the ironic container through HTTP. Information The Ironic Python Agent is an agent for controlling and deploying Ironic controlled baremetal nodes. Typically run in a ramdisk, the agent exposes a REST API for provisioning servers. See below the code snippet that fullfil the task: sudo podman run -d --net host --privileged --name ipa-downloader --pod ironic-pod -e IPA_BASEURI= -v /opt/metal3-dev-env/ironic:/shared quay. io/metal3-io/ironic-ipa-downloader /usr/local/bin/get-resource. shBelow, it is shown the status of the pods and containers at this point: [root@eko1 metal3-dev-env]# podman pod list --ctr-namesPOD ID         NAME     STATUS    CREATED   CONTAINER INFO                                             INFRA ID5a0d475351aa   ironic-pod   Running   6 days ago   [5a0d475351aa-infra] [ipa-downloader]                      18f3a8f61407The process will wait until the ironic-python-agent (IPA) initramfs, kernel and headers files are downloaded successfully.

Libvirt daemon should be running so that minikube can be installed successfully. See the following script snippet starting the minikube VM: + sudo su -l -c 'minikube start --insecure-registry 192. 168. 111. 1:5000'* minikube v1. 6. 2 on Centos 7. 7. 1908* Selecting 'kvm2' driver from user configuration (alternates: [none])In the same way as with the host, container images are pre-cached but in this case inside minikube local image repository.  Notice that in this case the Bare Metal operator (BMO) is also downloaded since it will run on minikube. The container location is defined by BAREMETAL_OPERATOR_IMAGE. In case you want to test new features or new fixes to the BMO, just change the value of the variable to match the location of the modified image:       Name of the variable   Default value       BAREMETAL_OPERATOR_IMAGE   quay. io/metal3-io/baremetal-operator   Note Remember that minikube is the management cluster in our environment. So it must run all the operators and controllers needed for Metal³.

Virtual BMC to emulate a real baseboard management controller (BMC).  Container registry where the virtual servers will pull the images needed to run a K8s installation. Information A baseboard management controller (BMC) is a specialized service processor that monitors the physical state of a computer, network server or other hardware device using sensors and communicating with the system administrator through an independent connection. The BMC is part of the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) and is usually contained in the motherboard or main circuit board of the device to be monitored. First, an ssh-key in charge of communicating to libvirt is created if it does not exist previously. This key is called id_rsa_virt_power. It is added to the root authorized_keys and is used by the vbmc and sushy tools to contact libvirt. Information sushy-tools is a set of simple simulation tools aiming at supporting the development and testing of the Redfish protocol implementations. Next, another Ansible playbook called setup-playbook. yml is run against the host. It is focused on set up the virtual infrastructure around metal3-dev-env. Below it is shown the Ansible variables that are passed to the playbook, which actually are obtaining the values from the global variables defined in the common. sh or the configuration file. ANSIBLE_FORCE_COLOR=true ansible-playbook \  -e  working_dir=$WORKING_DIR  \  -e  num_nodes=$NUM_NODES  \  -e  extradisks=$VM_EXTRADISKS  \  -e  virthost=$HOSTNAME  \  -e  platform=$NODES_PLATFORM  \  -e  libvirt_firmware=$LIBVIRT_FIRMWARE  \  -e  default_memory=$DEFAULT_HOSTS_MEMORY  \  -e  manage_baremetal=$MANAGE_BR_BRIDGE  \  -e  provisioning_url_host=$PROVISIONING_URL_HOST  \  -i vm-setup/inventory. ini \  -b -vvv vm-setup/setup-playbook. yml      Name of the variable   Default value         WORKING_DIR   /opt/metal3-dev-env       NUM_NODES   2       VM_EXTRADISKS   false       HOSTNAME   hostname       NODES_PLATFORM   libvirt       LIBVIRT_FIRMWARE   bios       DEFAULT_HOSTS_MEMORY   8192       MANAGE_BR_BRIDGE   y       PROVISIONING_URL_HOST   172. 22. 0. 1   Information There are variables that are only defined as Ansible variables, e. g. number of CPUs of the virtual bare metal server, size of disks, etc. In case you would like to change properties not defined globally in the metal3-dev-env take a look a the default variables specified in role: common and libvirt Thesetup-playbook. yml is composed by 3 roles, which are detailed below:    Common.   This role sets up the virtual hardware and network configuration of the VMs. Actually it is a dependency of the libvirt and virtbmc Ansible roles. This means that the common role must always be executed before the roles that depend on them. Also, they are only executed once. If two roles state the same one as their dependency, it is only executed the first time.      Libvirt.   It actually is the role that configures the virtual bare metal servers. They are all identically defined with the same hardware and network configuration. Note that they are not started since they will be booted later by ironic during the provisioning process. Note It is possible to change the number of VMs to provision by replacing the value of NUMBER_NODES  Finally, once the VMs are defined and we have their MAC address, the ironic inventory file ironic_nodes_json is created. The action of creating a node is part of the enrollment process and the first step to prepare a node to reach the “available” status. {  nodes : [  {    name :  node-0 ,    driver :  ipmi ,    resource_class :  baremetal ,    driver_info : {     username :  admin ,     password :  password ,     port :  6230 ,     address :  ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6230 ,     deploy_kernel :  http://172. 22. 0. 1/images/ironic-python-agent. kernel ,     deploy_ramdisk :  http://172. 22. 0. 1/images/ironic-python-agent. initramfs    },    ports : [    {      address :  00:00:e0:4b:24:8b ,      pxe_enabled : true    }   ],    properties : {     local_gb :  50 ,     cpu_arch :  x86_64    }  },  {    name :  node-1 ,    driver :  ipmi ,    resource_class :  baremetal ,    driver_info : {     username :  admin ,     password :  password ,     port :  6231 ,     address :  ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6231 ,     deploy_kernel :  http://172. 22. 0. 1/images/ironic-python-agent. kernel ,     deploy_ramdisk :  http://172. 22. 0. 1/images/ironic-python-agent. initramfs    },    ports : [    {      address :  00:00:e0:4b:24:8f ,      pxe_enabled : true    }   ],    properties : {     local_gb :  50 ,     cpu_arch :  x86_64    }  },Information This role is also used to tear down the virtual infrastructure depending on the variable libvirt_action inside the Ansible role: setup or teardown.    Virtbmc  This role is only executed if the bare metal virtual machines are created in libvirt, because vbmc needs libvirt to emulate a real BMC. Information VirtualBMC (vmbc) tool simulates a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) by exposing IPMI responder to the network and talking to libvirt at the host vBMC is running at. Basically, manipulate virtual machines which pretend to be bare metal servers.  The virtbmc Ansible role creates the vbmc and sushy-tools configuration in the host for each virtual bare metal nodes. Note that each virtual bare metal host will have a different vbmc socket exposed in the host. The communication to each vbmc is needed by the BMO to start, stop, configure the boot order, etc during the provisioning stage. Finally, this folders containing the configuration will be mounted by the vbmc and sushy-tools containers.    [alosadag@eko1 metal3-dev-env]$ sudo ls -l --color /opt/metal3-dev-env/virtualbmctotal 0drwxr-x---. 2 root root 21 Feb 5 11:07 sushy-toolsdrwxr-x---. 4 root root 70 Feb 5 11:08 vbmc Next, both host provisioning and baremetal interfaces are configured. The provisioning interface, as the name suggests, will be used to provision the virtual bare metal hosts by means of the `Bare Metal Operator`. This interface is configured with an static IP (172. 22. 0. 1):```sh[alosadag@smc-master metal3-dev-env]$ ifconfig provisioningprovisioning: flags=4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500        inet 172. 22. 0. 1  netmask 255. 255. 255. 0  broadcast 172. 22. 0. 255        inet6 fe80::1091:c1ff:fea1:6a0f  prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x20&lt;link&gt;        ether 12:91:c1:a1:6a:0f  txqueuelen 1000 (Ethernet)On the other hand, the baremetal virtual interface behaves as an external network. This interface is able to reach the internet and it is the network where the different Kubernetes nodes will exchange information. This interface is configured as auto, so the IP is retrieved by DHCP. [alosadag@smc-master metal3-dev-env]$ ifconfig baremetalbaremetal: flags=4099&lt;UP,BROADCAST,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500        inet 192. 168. 111. 1  netmask 255. 255. 255. 0  broadcast 192. 168. 111. 255        ether 52:54:00:db:85:29  txqueuelen 1000 (Ethernet)Next, an Ansible role called firewall will be executed targetting the host to be sure that the proper ports are opened. In case your host is running Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS 8, firewalld module will be used. In any other case, iptables module is the choice. Below, the code snippet where firewalld or iptables is assigned: # Use firewalld on CentOS/RHEL, iptables everywhere elseexport USE_FIREWALLD=Falseif [[ ($OS ==  rhel  || $OS =  centos ) &amp;&amp; ${OS_VERSION} == 8 ]]then  export USE_FIREWALLD=TruefiNote This behaviour can be changed by replacing the value of the USE_FIREWALLD variable The ports managed by this role are all associated to the services that take part of the provisioning process: ironic, vbmc, httpd, pxe, container registry. . Note Services like ironic, pxe, keepalived, httpd and the container registry are running in the host as containers attached to the host network on the host’s provisioning interface. On the other hand, the vbmc service is also running as a privileged container and it is listening in the host’s baremetal interface. Once the network is configured, a local container registry is started. It will be needed in the case of using local built images. In that case, the container images can be modified locally and pushed to the local registry. At that point, the specific image location variable must be changed so it must point out the local registry. This process makes easy to verify and test changes to the code locally. At this point the following containers are running inside two pods on the host: infra-pod and ironic-pod. [root@eko1 metal3-dev-env]# podman pod list --ctr-namesPOD ID         NAME     STATUS    CREATED   CONTAINER INFO                                             INFRA ID67cc53713145   infra-pod  Running   6 days ago  [vbmc] [sushy-tools] [httpd-infra] [67cc53713145-infra]    f1da23fcd77f5a0d475351aa   ironic-pod  Running   6 days ago  [5a0d475351aa-infra] [ipa-downloader]                      18f3a8f61407Below are detailed the containers inside the infra-pod pod which are running as privileged using the host network:    The httpd container. &gt; &gt;A folder called shared where the cloud OS image and IPA files are available is mounted and exposed to the virtual bare metal hosts.     sudo podman run -d –net host –privileged –name httpd-infra –pod infra-pod -v /opt/metal3-dev-env/ironic:/shared –entrypoint /bin/runhttpd quay. io/metal3-io/ironic&gt; This folder also contains the `inspector. ipxe` file which contains the information needed to be able to run the `ironic-python-agent` kernel and initramfs. Below, httpd-infra container is accessed and it has been verified that host's `/opt/metal3-dev-env/ironic/` (`IRONIC_DATA_DIR`) is mounted inside the *shared* folder of the container:```sh[alosadag@eko1 metal3-dev-env]$ sudo podman exec -it httpd-infra bash[root@infra-pod shared]# cat html/inspector. ipxe #!ipxe:retry_bootecho In inspector. ipxeimgfree# NOTE(dtantsur): keep inspection kernel params in [mdns]params in ironic-inspector-imagekernel --timeout 60000 http://172. 22. 0. 1:80/images/ironic-python-agent. kernel ipa-inspection-callback-url=http://172. 22. 0. 1:5050/v1/continue ipa-inspection-collectors=default,extra-hardware,logs systemd. journald. forward_to_console=yes BOOTIF=${mac} ipa-debug=1 ipa-inspection-dhcp-all-interfaces=1 ipa-collect-lldp=1 initrd=ironic-python-agent. initramfs || goto retry_bootinitrd --timeout 60000 http://172. 22. 0. 1:80/images/ironic-python-agent. initramfs || goto retry_bootboot   The vbmc container.   This container mounts two host folders. One is the /opt/metal3-dev-env/virtualbmc/vbmc where the vbmc configuration for each node is stored.

This container mounts the /opt/metal3-dev-env/virtualbmc/sushy-tools config folder and the/root/. sshlocal folder as well. The functionality is similar as thevbmc`, however this use redfish instead of ipmi to connect to the BMC.  + sudo podman run -d --net host --privileged --name sushy-tools --pod infra-pod -v /opt/metal3-dev-env/virtualbmc/&gt; sushy-tools:/root/sushy -v /root/. ssh:/root/ssh quay. io/metal3-io/sushy-tools Information At this point the virtual infrastructure must be ready to apply the Kubernetes specific configuration. Note that all the VMs specified by NUMBER_NODES and minikube must be shut down and the defined virtual network must be active: [alosadag@smc-master metal3-dev-env]$ sudo virsh list --all Id    Name                          State---------------------------------------------------- -     minikube                       shut off -     node_0                         shut off -     node_1                         shut off -     node_2                         shut off[alosadag@smc-master metal3-dev-env]$ sudo virsh net-list --all Name                 State   Autostart     Persistent---------------------------------------------------------- baremetal            active   yes        yes default              active   yes        yes minikube-net         active   yes        yes provisioning         active   yes        yesIn the video below it is exhibited all the configuration explained and executed during this second step. Step 3: Launch the management cluster (minikube): The third script called 03_launch_mgmt_cluster. sh basically configures minikube to become a Metal³ management cluster. On top of minikube the baremetal-operator, capi-controller-manager, capbm-controller-manager and cabpk-controller-manager are installed in the metal3 namespace. In a more detailed way, the script clones the Bare Metal Operator (BMO) and Cluster API Provider for Managed Bare Metal Hardware operator (CAPBM) git repositories, creates the cloud. yaml file and starts the minikube virtual machine. Once minikube is up and running, the BMO is built and executed in minikube’s Kubernetes cluster. In case of the Bare Metal Operator the branch by default to clone is master, however this and other variables shown in the following table can be replaced in the config file: + BMOREPO=https://github. com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator. git+ BMOBRANCH=master      Name of the variable   Default value   Options         BMOREPO   https://github. com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator. git           BMOBRANCH   master           CAPBMREPO   https://github. com/metal3-io/cluster-api-provider-baremetal. git           CAPI_VERSION   v1alpha2   v1alpha1 or v1alpha3       FORCE_REPO_UPDATE   false           BMO_RUN_LOCAL   false           CAPBM_RUN_LOCAL   false       Once the BMO variables are configured, it is time for the operator to be deployed using kustomize and kubectl as it can seen from the logs:  Information: Kustomize is a Kubernetes tool that lets you customize raw, template-free YAML files for multiple purposes, leaving the original YAML untouched and usable as is. + kustomize build bmo-dirPrHIrcl+ kubectl apply -f-namespace/metal3 createdcustomresourcedefinition. apiextensions. k8s. io/baremetalhosts. metal3. io createdserviceaccount/metal3-baremetal-operator createdclusterrole. rbac. authorization. k8s. io/metal3-baremetal-operator createdclusterrolebinding. rbac. authorization. k8s. io/metal3-baremetal-operator createdconfigmap/ironic-bmo-configmap-75tkt49k5c createdsecret/mariadb-password-d88m524c46 createddeployment. apps/metal3-baremetal-operator createdOnce the BMO objects are applied, it’s time to transform the virtual bare metal hosts information into a yaml file of kind BareMetalHost Custom Resource (CR). This is done by a golang script passing them the IPMI address, BMC username and password, which are stored as a Kubernetes secret, MAC address and name: + go run /home/alosadag/go/src/github. com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/cmd/make-bm-worker/main. go -address ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6230 -password password -user admin -boot-mac 00:be:bc:fd:17:f3 node-0+ read -r name address user password mac+ go run /home/alosadag/go/src/github. com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/cmd/make-bm-worker/main. go -address ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6231 -password password -user admin -boot-mac 00:be:bc:fd:17:f7 node-1+ read -r name address user password mac+ go run /home/alosadag/go/src/github. com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/cmd/make-bm-worker/main. go -address ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6232 -password password -user admin -boot-mac 00:be:bc:fd:17:fb node-2+ read -r name address user password macBelow is shown the bare metal host definition of node-1.

All virtual bare metal hosts configured must be shown as BareMetalHosts resources in the metal3 namespace as well. They should be in ready status and stopped (online is false) In the video below it is exhibited all the configuration explained and executed during this third step. Step 4: Verification: The last script 04_verify. sh is in charge of verifying that the deployment has been successful by checking several things:  Custom resources (CR) and custom resource definition (CRD) were applied and exist in the cluster.  Verify that the virtual bare metal hosts matches the information detailed in theBareMetalHost object.  All containers are in running status.  Verify virtual network configuration and status.  Verify operators and controllers are running. However, this verification can be easily achieved manually. For instance, checking that controllers and operators running in the management cluster (minikube) and all the virtual bare metal hosts are in ready status: [alosadag@eko1 ~]$ kubectl get pods -n metal3 -o wideNAME                                         READY  STATUS  RESTARTS  AGE   IP            NODE    NOMINATED NODE  READINESS GATEScabpk-controller-manager-5c67dd56c4-wfwbh    2/2     Running   9     6d23h   172. 17. 0. 5    minikube   &lt;none&gt;      &lt;none&gt;capbm-controller-manager-7f9b8f96b7-grl4r    2/2     Running   12     6d23h   172. 17. 0. 4    minikube   &lt;none&gt;      &lt;none&gt;capi-controller-manager-798c76675f-dxh2n     1/1    Running   10     6d23h   172. 17. 0. 6    minikube   &lt;none&gt;      &lt;none&gt;metal3-baremetal-operator-5b4c59755d-h4zkp   6/6     Running   8     6d23h   192. 168. 39. 101  minikube   &lt;none&gt;      &lt;none&gt;Verify that the BareMetalHosts provisioning status is ready and the BMC configuration is correct.

Summary: In this post a deep dive into the metal3-dev-env scripts was shown. It has been deeply detailed the process of creating a Metal³ emulated environment from a set of virtual machines (VMs) to manage as if they were bare metal hosts. After this post, the reader should have acquired a basic understanding of all the pieces involved in the Metal³ project. Also, and more important, how these scripts can be adapted to your specific needs. Remember that this can be achieved in multiple ways: replacing values in the global variables, replacing Ansible default variables or even modifying playbooks or the scripts themselves. Notice that the Metal³ development environment also focuses on developing new features of the BMO or CAPBM and being able to test them locally.

    "body": "Introduction: The baremetal operator, documented at https://github. com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/blob/master/docs/api. md, it’s the Operator in charge of definitions of physical hosts, containing information about how to reach the Out of Band management controller, URL with the desired image to provision, plus other properties related with hosts being used for provisioning instances. Quoting from the project:  The Bare Metal Operator implements a Kubernetes API for managing bare metal hosts. It maintains an inventory of available hosts as instances of the BareMetalHost Custom Resource Definition. The Bare Metal Operator knows how to:Inspect the host’s hardware details and report them on the corresponding BareMetalHost. This includes information about CPUs, RAM, disks, NICs, and more. Provision hosts with a desired imageClean a host’s disk contents before or after provisioning. A bit more in deep approach: The Baremetal Operator (BMO) keeps a mapping of each host and its management interfaces (vendor based like iLO, iDrac, iRMC, etc) and controlled via IPMI. All of this is defined in a CRD, for example: apiVersion: v1kind: Secretmetadata: name: metal3-node01-credentials namespace: metal3type: Opaquedata: username: YWRtaW4= password: YWRtaW4=---apiVersion: metal3. io/v1alpha1kind: BareMetalHostmetadata: name: metal3-node01 namespace: metal3spec: bmc:  address: ipmi://172. 22. 0. 2:6230  credentialsName: metal3-node01-credentials bootMACAddress: 00:c2:fc:3b:e1:01 description:    hardwareProfile:  libvirt  online: falseWith above values (described in API), we’re telling the operator:  MAC: Defines the mac address of the NIC connected to the network that will be used for provision the host bmc: defines the management controller address and the secret used credentialsName: Defines the name of the secret containing username/password for accessing the IPMI serviceOnce the server is ‘defined’ via the CRD, the underlying service (provided by ironic1 as of this writing) is inspected: [root@metal3-kubernetes ~]# kubectl get baremetalhost -n metal3NAME      STATUS  PROVISIONING STATUS  CONSUMER  BMC           HARDWARE PROFILE  ONLINE  ERRORmetal3-node01  OK    inspecting            ipmi://172. 22. 0. 1:6230           falseOnce the inspection has finished, the status will change to ready and made available for provisioning.

    "body": "Originally posted at https://www. underkube. com/posts/metal3/ In this blog post, I’m going to try to explain in my own words a high leveloverview of what Metal3 is, the motivation behind it and some concepts relatedto a ‘baremetal operator’. Let’s have some definitions! Custom Resource Definition: The k8s API provides some out-of-the-box objects such as pods, services, etc. There are a few methods of extending the k8s API (such as API extensions)but since a few releases back, the k8s API can be extended easily with custom resources definitions (CRDs). Basically this means you can virtually create any type of object definition in k8s(actually only user with cluster-admin capabilities) with a yaml such as: apiVersion: apiextensions. k8s. io/v1beta1kind: CustomResourceDefinitionmetadata: # name must match the spec fields below, and be in the form: &lt;plural&gt;. &lt;group&gt; name: crontabs. stable. example. comspec: # group name to use for REST API: /apis/&lt;group&gt;/&lt;version&gt; group: stable. example. com # list of versions supported by this CustomResourceDefinition versions:  - name: v1   # Each version can be enabled/disabled by Served flag.    served: true   # One and only one version must be marked as the storage version.    storage: true # either Namespaced or Cluster scope: Namespaced names:  # plural name to be used in the URL: /apis/&lt;group&gt;/&lt;version&gt;/&lt;plural&gt;  plural: crontabs  # singular name to be used as an alias on the CLI and for display  singular: crontab  # kind is normally the CamelCased singular type. Your resource manifests use this.   kind: CronTab  # shortNames allow shorter string to match your resource on the CLI  shortNames:   - ct preserveUnknownFields: false validation:  openAPIV3Schema:   type: object   properties:    spec:     type: object     properties:      cronSpec:       type: string      image:       type: string      replicas:       type: integerAnd after kubectl apply -f you can kubectl get crontabs. There are tons of information with regards to CRDs, like the k8s official documentation. The CRD by himself is not useful ‘per se’ as nobody will take care of it (that’s why I said definition). Itrequires a controller to watch for those new objects and react to differentevents affecting the object. Controller: A controller is basically a loop that watches the current status of an objectand if it is different from the desired status, it fix it (reconciliation). This is why k8s is ‘declarative’, you specify the object desired status instead‘how to do it’ (imperative). Again, there are tons of documentation (and examples) around the controller pattern which isbasically the k8s roots, so I’ll let your google-foo take care of it :) Operator: An Operator (in k8s slang) is an application running in your k8scluster that deploys, manages and maintain (so, operates) a k8s application. This k8s application (the one that the operator manages), can be as simple as a ‘hello world’ applicationcontainerized and deployed in your k8s cluster or it can be a much more complexthing, such a database cluster. The ‘operator’ is like an ‘expert sysadmin’ containerized that takes care ofyour application. Bear in mind that the ‘expert’ tag (meaning the automation behind the operator)depends on the operator implementation… so there can be basic operators thatonly deploy your application or complex operators that handle day 2 operationssuch as upgrades, fail overs, backup/restore, etc. See the CoreOS operator definition for more information. Cloud Controller Manager: k8s code is smart enough to be able to leveragethe underlying infrastructure where the cluster is running, such as being ableof creating ‘LoadBalancer’ services, understanding the cluster topology based on the cloud provider AZs where the nodes are running (for scheduling reasons), etc. This task of ‘talking to the cloud provider’ is performed by the Cloud Controller Manager (CCM) and for moreinformation you can take a look at the official k8s documentation withregards the architecture and the administration (also, if you are brave enough, you can create your own cloud controller manager ) Cluster API: The Cluster API implementation is a WIP ‘framework’ that allows a k8s cluster to manage itself, including the ability of creating new clusters, adding more nodes, etc. in a ‘k8s way’ (declarative, controllers, CRDs, etc. ), so there are objects such as Cluster that can be expressed as k8s objects: apiVersion:  cluster. k8s. io/v1alpha1 kind: Clustermetadata: name: myclusterspec: clusterNetwork:  services:   cidrBlocks: [ 10. 96. 0. 0/12 ]  pods:   cidrBlocks: [ 192. 168. 0. 0/16 ]  serviceDomain:  cluster. local  providerSpec: . . . but also:  Machine type objects [MachineSet type objects](https://github. com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/master/pkg/apis/cluster/v1alpha1/machineset_types. go) MachineDeployment type objects etcThere are someprovider implementations in the wild such as the AWS, Azure, GCP, OpenStack,vSphere, etc. ones and the Cluster API project is driven by the SIG Cluster Lifecycle. Please review the official Cluster API repository for more information. Actuator: The actuator is a Cluster API interface that reacts to changes to Machineobjects reconciliating the Machine status. The actuator code is tightly coupled with the provider (that’s why it is aninterface) such as the AWS one. MachineSet vs Machine: To simplify, let’s say that MachineSets are to Machines what ReplicaSets areto Pods. So you can scale the Machines in your cluster just by changingthe number of replicas of a MachineSet. Cluster API vs Cloud Providers: As we have seen, the Cluster API leverages the provider related to the k8sinfrastructure itself (clusters and nodes) and the CCM and the cloud providerintegration for k8s is to leverage the cloud provider to provide support infrastructure. Let’s say Cluster API is for the k8s administrators and theCCM is for the k8s users :) Machine API: The OpenShift 4 Machine API is a combination of some of the upstream Cluster APIwith custom OpenShift resources and it is designed to work in conjunction withthe Cluster Version Operator. OpenShift’s Machine API Operator: The machine-api-operator isan operator that manages the Machine API objects in an OpenShift 4 cluster. The operator is capable of creating machines in AWS and libvirt (more providerscoming soon) via the Machine Controller and it is included out of thebox with OCP 4 (and can be deployed in a k8s vanilla as well) Baremetal: A baremetal server (or bare-metal) is just a computer server. The last years terms such as virtualization, containers, serverless, etc. have beenpopular but at the end of the day, all the code running on top of a SaaS, PaaSor IaaS is actually running in a real physical server stored in a datacenterwired to routers, switches and power. That server is a ‘baremetal’ server. If you are used to cloud providers and instances, you probably don’t know thepains of baremetal management… including things such as connecting to thevirtual console (usually it requires an old java version) to debug issues,configuring pxe for provisioning baremetal hosts (or attach ISOs via the virtual console… or insert a CD/DVD physically into the CD carry if you are‘lucky’ enough…), configuring VLANs for traffic isolation, etc. That kind of operations is not ‘cloud’ ready and there are tools that providebaremetal management, such as maas or ironic. Ironic: OpenStack bare metal provisioning (or ironic) is an open source project (or even better, a number of open source projects) to manage baremetal hosts. Ironic avoids the administrator to deal with pxe configuration, manual deployments, etc. and provides a defined API and a series of plugins to interact with different baremetal models and vendors. Ironic is used in OpenStack to provide baremetal objects but there are someprojects (such as bifrost) to useIronic ‘standalone’ (so, no OpenStack required) Metal3: Metal3 is a project aimed at providing a baremetal operator thatimplements the Cluster API framework required to be able to manage baremetalin a k8s way (easy peasy!). It uses ironic under the hood to avoid reinventing thewheel, but consider it as an implementation detail that may change. The Metal3 baremetal operator watches for BareMetalHost (CRD) objects defined as: apiVersion: metal3. io/v1alpha1kind: BareMetalHostmetadata: name: my-worker-0spec: online: true bootMACAddress: 00:11:22:33:44:55 bmc:  address: ipmi://my-worker-0. ipmi. example. com  credentialsName: my-worker-0-bmc-secretThere are a few more fields in the BareMetalHost object such as the image, hardware profile, etc. The Metal3 project is actually divided into two different components: baremetal-operator: The Metal3 baremetal-operator is the component that manages baremetal hosts. It exposes a new BareMetalHost custom resource in the k8s API that lets you manage hosts in a declarative way. cluster-api-provider-baremetal: The Metal3 cluster-api-provider-baremetal includes the integration with the Cluster API project. This provider currently includes a Machine actuator that acts as a client of the BareMetalHost custom resources. BareMetalHost vs Machine vs Node:  BareMetalHost is a Metal3 object Machine is a Cluster API object Node is where the pods run :)Those three concepts are linked in a 1:1:1 relationship meaning: A BareMetalHost created with Metal3 maps to a Machine object and once theinstallation procedure finishes, a new kubernetes node will be added to thecluster. $ kubectl get nodesNAME                     STATUS  ROLES  AGE  VERSIONmy-node-0. example. com            Ready  master  25h  v1. 14. 0$ kubectl get machines --all-namespacesNAMESPACE        NAME         INSTANCE  STATE  TYPE  REGION  ZONE  AGEopenshift-machine-api  my-node-0                          25h$ kubectl get baremetalhosts --allnamespacesNAMESPACE       NAME   STATUS PROVISIONING STATUS MACHINE BMC HARDWARE PROFILE ONLINE ERRORopenshift-machine-api my-node-0 OK   provisioned my-node-0. example. com ipmi://1. 2. 3. 4 unknown trueThe 1:1 relationship for the BareMetalHost and the Machine is stored in themachineRef field in the BareMetalHost object: $ kubectl get baremetalhost/my-node-0 -n openshift-machine-api -o jsonpath='{. spec. machineRef}'map[name:my-node-0 namespace:openshift-machine-api]In a Machine annotation: $ kubectl get machines my-node-0 -n openshift-machine-api -o jsonpath='{. metadata. annotations}'map[metal3. io/BareMetalHost:openshift-machine-api/my-node-0]The 1:1 relationship for the Machine and the Node currently requires toexecute the link-machine-and-node. sh script to modify the Machineobject . status field: . /link-machine-and-node. sh MACHINE NODEThen, the reference is stored in the . status. nodeRef. name field in theMachine object: $ kubectl get machine my-node-0 -o jsonpath='{. status. nodeRef. name}'my-node-0. example. comRecap: Being able to ‘just scale a node’ in k8s means a lot of underlying concepts and technologies involved behind the scenes :) Resources/links:  https://dzone. com/articles/introducing-the-kubernetes-cluster-api-project-2 https://blogs. vmware. com/cloudnative/2019/03/14/what-and-why-of-cluster-api/ https://github. com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api https://github. com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-aws https://itnext. io/deep-dive-to-cluster-api-a0b4e792d57d https://www. linux. com/blog/event/kubecon/2018/4/extending-kubernetes-cluster-api"

    "body": "Originally posted at https://blog. russellbryant. net/2019/04/30/metal%c2%b3-metal-kubed-bare-metal-provisioning-for-kubernetes/ Project Introduction: There are a number of great open source tools for bare metal host provisioning, including Ironic. Metal³ aims to build on these technologies to provide a Kubernetes native API for managing bare metal hosts via a provisioning stack that is also running on Kubernetes. We believe that Kubernetes Native Infrastructure, or managing your infrastructure just like your applications, is a powerful next step in the evolution of infrastructure management. The Metal³ project is also building integration with the Kubernetes cluster-api project, allowing Metal³ to be used as an infrastructure backend for Machine objects from the Cluster API. Metal3 Repository Overview: There is a Metal³ overview and some more detailed design documents in the metal3-docs repository. The baremetal-operator is the component that manages bare metal hosts. It exposes a new BareMetalHost custom resource in the Kubernetes API that lets you manage hosts in a declarative way. Finally, the cluster-api-provider-baremetal repository includes integration with the cluster-api project. This provider currently includes a Machine actuator that acts as a client of the BareMetalHost custom resources. Demo: The project has been going for a few months now, and there’s enough now to show some working code. For this demonstration, I’ve started with a 3 node Kubernetes cluster installed using OpenShift. $ kubectl get nodesNAME    STATUS  ROLES  AGE  VERSIONmaster-0  Ready  master  24h  v1. 13. 4+d4ce02c1dmaster-1  Ready  master  24h  v1. 13. 4+d4ce02c1dmaster-2  Ready  master  24h  v1. 13. 4+d4ce02c1dMachine objects were created to reflect these 3 masters, as well. $ kubectl get machinesNAME       INSTANCE  STATE  TYPE  REGION  ZONE  AGEostest-master-0                       24hostest-master-1                       24hostest-master-2                       24hFor this cluster-api provider, a Machine has a corresponding BareMetalHost object, which corresponds to the piece of hardware we are managing. There is a design document that covers the relationship between Nodes, Machines, and BareMetalHosts. Since these hosts were provisioned earlier, they are in a special externally provisioned state, indicating that we enrolled them in management while they were already running in a desired state. If changes are needed going forward, the baremetal-operator will be able to automate them. $ kubectl get baremetalhostsNAME         STATUS  PROVISIONING STATUS   MACHINE      BMC             HARDWARE PROFILE  ONLINE  ERRORopenshift-master-0  OK    externally provisioned  ostest-master-0  ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6230           trueopenshift-master-1  OK    externally provisioned  ostest-master-1  ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6231           trueopenshift-master-2  OK    externally provisioned  ostest-master-2  ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6232           trueNow suppose we’d like to expand this cluster by adding another bare metal host to serve as a worker node. First we need to create a new BareMetalHost object that adds this new host to the inventory of hosts managed by the baremetal-operator. Here’s the YAML for the new BareMetalHost: ---apiVersion: v1kind: Secretmetadata: name: openshift-worker-0-bmc-secrettype: Opaquedata: username: YWRtaW4= password: cGFzc3dvcmQ=---apiVersion: metalkube. org/v1alpha1kind: BareMetalHostmetadata: name: openshift-worker-0spec: online: true bmc:  address: ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6233  credentialsName: openshift-worker-0-bmc-secret bootMACAddress: 00:ab:4f:d8:9e:faNow to add the BareMetalHost and its IPMI credentials Secret to the cluster: $ kubectl create -f worker_crs. yamlsecret/openshift-worker-0-bmc-secret createdbaremetalhost. metalkube. org/openshift-worker-0 createdThe list of BareMetalHosts now reflects a new host in the inventory that is ready to be provisioned. It will remain in this ready state until it is claimed by a new Machine object. $ kubectl get baremetalhostsNAME         STATUS  PROVISIONING STATUS   MACHINE      BMC             HARDWARE PROFILE  ONLINE  ERRORopenshift-master-0  OK    externally provisioned  ostest-master-0  ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6230           trueopenshift-master-1  OK    externally provisioned  ostest-master-1  ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6231           trueopenshift-master-2  OK    externally provisioned  ostest-master-2  ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6232           trueopenshift-worker-0  OK    ready                   ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6233  unknown      trueWe have a MachineSet already created for workers, but it scaled down to 0. $ kubectl get machinesetsNAME       DESIRED  CURRENT  READY  AVAILABLE  AGEostest-worker-0  0     0               24hWe can scale this MachineSet to 1 to indicate that we’d like a worker provisioned. The baremetal cluster-api provider will then look for an available BareMetalHost, claim it, and trigger provisioning of that host. $ kubectl scale machineset ostest-worker-0 --replicas=1 After the new Machine was created, our cluster-api provider claimed the available host and triggered it to be provisioned. $ kubectl get baremetalhostsNAME         STATUS  PROVISIONING STATUS   MACHINE         BMC             HARDWARE PROFILE  ONLINE  ERRORopenshift-master-0  OK    externally provisioned  ostest-master-0     ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6230           trueopenshift-master-1  OK    externally provisioned  ostest-master-1     ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6231           trueopenshift-master-2  OK    externally provisioned  ostest-master-2     ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6232           trueopenshift-worker-0  OK    provisioning       ostest-worker-0-jmhtc  ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6233  unknown      trueThis process takes some time. Under the hood, the baremetal-operator is driving Ironic through a provisioning process. This begins with wiping disks to ensure the host comes up in a clean state. It will eventually write the desired OS image to disk and then reboot into that OS. When complete, a new Kubernetes Node will register with the cluster. $ kubectl get baremetalhostsNAME         STATUS  PROVISIONING STATUS   MACHINE         BMC             HARDWARE PROFILE  ONLINE  ERRORopenshift-master-0  OK    externally provisioned  ostest-master-0     ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6230           trueopenshift-master-1  OK    externally provisioned  ostest-master-1     ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6231           trueopenshift-master-2  OK    externally provisioned  ostest-master-2     ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6232           trueopenshift-worker-0  OK    provisioned       ostest-worker-0-jmhtc  ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6233  unknown      true$ kubectl get nodesNAME    STATUS  ROLES  AGE  VERSIONmaster-0  Ready  master  24h  v1. 13. 4+d4ce02c1dmaster-1  Ready  master  24h  v1. 13. 4+d4ce02c1dmaster-2  Ready  master  24h  v1. 13. 4+d4ce02c1dworker-0  Ready  worker  68s  v1. 13. 4+d4ce02c1dThe following screen cast demonstrates this process, as well: Removing a bare metal host from the cluster is very similar.

    "body": "The Register; Raise some horns: Red Hat’s Metal³ aims to make Kubernetes on bare machines simple: Max Smolaks talks in this article about the OpenInfra Days in the UK, 2019: where Metal³ was revealed earlier last week by Steve Hardy, Red Hat’s senior principal software engineer. The Open Infrastructure Days in the UK is an event organised by the local Open Infrastructure community and supported by the OpenStack Foundation. The Open-source software developers at Red Hat are working on a tool that would simplify deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters on bare-metal servers. Steve told The reg:  “In some situations, you won’t want to run a full OpenStack infrastructure-as-a-service layer to provide, potentially, for multiple Kubernetes clusters”. Hardy is a notable contributor to OpenStack, having previously worked on Heat and TripleO projects. He said one of the reasons for choosing Ironic was its active development – and when new features get added to Ironic, the Metal³ team gets them “for free”.  “OpenStack has always been a modular set of projects, and people have always had the opportunity to reuse components for different applications. This is just an example of where we are leveraging one particular component for infrastructure management, just as an alternative to using a full infrastructure API,” Hardy said. Thierry Carrez, veep of engineering at the OpenStack Foundation also told The Reg:  “I like the fact that the projects end up being reusable on their own, for the functions they bring to the table – this helps us integrate with adjacent communities”. Hardy also commented:  It’s still early days for Metal³ - the project has just six contributors, and there’s no telling when it might reach release. “It’s a very, very young project but we are keen to get more community participation and feedback,”.

    "body": " -     Documentation    The Metal³ project (pronounced: Metal Kubed) exists to provide components that allow you to do bare metal host management for Kubernetes. Metal³ works as a Kubernetes application, meaning it runs on Kubernetes and is managed through Kubernetes interfaces. &lt;/section&gt; const childrens = document. querySelectorAll(“. mk-infograph__item”); // childrens. style. backgroundColor = ‘black’; const child = document. querySelector(“. mk-infograph__item”); // child. style. color = ‘white’; Array. prototype. forEach. call(document. querySelectorAll(“. mk-infograph__item”), function(  element ) {  element. onclick = addActive; }); function addActive(element) {  childrens. forEach(function(elem) {   elem. classList. remove(“mk–selected”);  });  element = this;  if (element. classList. contains(“mk–selected”)) {   element. classList. remove(“mk–selected”);  } else {   element. classList. add(“mk–selected”);  } }});&lt;/script&gt;           Metal3 Component Overview:                     It is helpful to understand the high level architecture of of the Machine API Integration. Click on each step to learn more about that particular component.                   Machine controller:           Bare metal actuator                          The first component is the Bare Metal Actuator, which is an implementation of the Machine Actuator interface defined by the cluster-api project. This actuator reacts to changes to Machine objects and acts as a client of the BareMetalHost custom resources managed by the Bare Metal                           Bare metal operator:           With CRDs representing bare metal inventory with configuration needed by its bare metal management workers.                             The architecture also includes a new Bare Metal Operator, which includes the following:             A Controller for a new Custom Resource, BareMetalHost. This custom resource represents an inventory of known (configured or automatically discovered) bare metal hosts. When a Machine is created the Bare Metal Actuator will claim one of these hosts to be provisioned as a new Kubernetes node.             In response to BareMetalHost updates, the controller will perform bare metal host provisioning actions as necessary to reach the desired state.             The creation of the BareMetalHost inventory can be done in two ways:                           Manually via creating BareMetalHost objects.               Optionally, automatically created via a bare metal host discovery process.                 For more information about Operators, see the operator-sdk.                                         Bare metal management pods:                           The operator manages a set of tools for controlling the power on the host, monitoring the host status, and provisioning images to the host. These tools run inside the pod with the operator, and do not require any configuration by the user.                                       APIs:    Enroll nodes by creating BareMetalHost resources. This would either bemanually or done by a component doing node discovery and introspection.   See the documentation in thebaremetal-operator repository for details.     Use the machine API to allocate a machine.   See the documentation in thecluster-api-provider-metal3repository for details.     The new Machine is associated with an available BareMetalHost, which triggersprovisioning of that host to join the cluster. This association is done bythe Actuator when it sets the MachineRef field on the BareMetalHost.  Design Documents: The design documents for Metal3 are all publicly available.

This uses Cluster APIv1alpha2 andassumes that metal3-dev-env is deployed with the environment variableCAPI_VERSION set to v1alpha2. The v1alpha2 deployment can be done withUbuntu 18. 04 or Centos 7 target host images. Please make sure to meet resourcerequirements for successfull deployment: $ . /scripts/v1alphaX/provision_cluster. sh$ . /scripts/v1alphaX/provision_controlplane. sh$ . /scripts/v1alphaX/provision_worker. shAt this point, the Machine actuator will respond and try to claim aBareMetalHost for this Machine. You can check the logs of the actuatorhere: $ kubectl logs -n capm3 pod/capm3-manager-7bbc6897c7-bp2pw -c manager09:10:38. 914458    controller-runtime/controller  msg = Starting Controller   controller = metal3cluster 09:10:38. 926489    controller-runtime/controller  msg = Starting workers   controller = metal3machine   worker count =110:54:16. 943712    Host matched hostSelector for Metal3Machine10:54:16. 943772    2 hosts available while choosing host for bare metal machine10:54:16. 944087    Associating machine with host10:54:17. 516274    Finished creating machine10:54:17. 518718    Provisioning BaremetalHostIf you look at the yaml representation of the Machine, you will see a newannotation that identifies which BareMetalHost was chosen to satisfy thisMachine request. $ kubectl get machine centos -n metal3 -o yaml. . .  annotations:  metal3. io/BareMetalHost: metal3/node-1. . .

If you want to deploy Centos 7 for the target hosts, the Centos 7 image requiresan update of Cloud-init. An updated image can be downloadedhere. You can replace the existing centos image with the following commands : curl -LO http://artifactory. nordix. org/artifactory/airship/images/centos. qcow2mv centos. qcow2 /opt/metal3-dev-env/ironic/html/images/centos-updated. qcow2md5sum /opt/metal3-dev-env/ironic/html/images/centos-updated. qcow2 | \awk '{print $1}' &gt; \/opt/metal3-dev-env/ironic/html/images/centos-updated. qcow2. md5sumDirectly Provisioning Bare Metal Hosts: It’s also possible to provision via the BareMetalHost interface directlywithout using the Cluster API integration. There is a helper script available to trigger provisioning of one of thesehosts. To provision a host with CentOS 7, run: $ . /provision_host. sh node-0The BareMetalHost will go through the provisioning process, and willeventually reboot into the operating system we wrote to disk. $ kubectl get baremetalhost node-0 -n metal3NAME    STATUS  PROVISIONING STATUS  MACHINE  BMC             HARDWARE PROFILE  ONLINE  ERRORnode-0   OK    provisioned           ipmi://192. 168. 111. 1:6230  unknown      trueprovision_host. sh will inject your SSH public key into the VM.

If you’d like to test changes to thebaremetal-operator, you can follow this process. First, you must scale down the deployment of the baremetal-operator runningin the cluster. kubectl scale deployment metal3-baremetal-operator -n metal3 --replicas=0To be able to run baremetal-operator locally, you need to installoperator-sdk. After that, you can runthe baremetal-operator including any custom changes. cd ~/go/src/github. com/metal3-io/baremetal-operatormake runRunning Custom Cluster API Provider Baremetal: There are two Cluster API related managers running in the cluster. Oneincludes set of generic controllers, and the other includes a custom Machinecontroller for Metal3. If you want to try changes tocluster-api-provider-metal3, you want to shut down the custom Machinecontroller manager first. $ kubectl scale statefulset capm3-controller-manager -n capm3-system --replicas=0Then you can run the custom Machine controller manager out of your local git tree. cd ~/go/src/github. com/metal3-io/cluster-api-provider-metal3make runAccessing Ironic API: Sometimes you may want to look directly at Ironic to debug something. The metal3-dev-env repository contains a clouds. yaml file withconnection settings for Ironic. metal3-dev-env will install the openstack command line tool on theprovisioning host as part of setting up the cluster. The openstack toolwill look for clouds. yaml in the current directory or you can copy it to~/. config/openstack/clouds. yaml. Version 3. 19. 0 or higher is needed tointeract with Ironic using clouds. yaml.
