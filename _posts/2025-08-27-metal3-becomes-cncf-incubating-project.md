We are pleased to share some incredible news with our community!  The CNCF
[Technical Oversight Committee][toc] has officially voted to accept Metal3 as an
incubating project. This milestone represents years of hard work, collaboration,
and innovation, and we couldn't be more excited about what lies ahead!

## Our Journey from Sandbox to Incubation

What started as a collaboration between Red Hat and Ericsson in 2019 has
blossomed into something truly special. When we joined the CNCF sandbox in
September 2020, we knew we had something powerful: a way to make bare metal
infrastructure as Kubernetes-native as any cloud platform. Today, that vision
has grown far beyond our initial dreams.

## The Numbers Tell Our Story

We're incredibly proud of what our community has accomplished together:

- **57 active contributing organizations** from around the globe
- **186 amazing contributors** who've shaped our project
- **8,368 merged pull requests** representing countless hours of collaboration
- **1,523 GitHub stars** from supporters worldwide
- **187 releases** of continuous improvement

But beyond the numbers, what makes us truly happy is seeing organizations like
Fujitsu, Ikea, SUSE, Ericsson, and Red Hat successfully deploying Metal3 in
production environments.

## What Makes Us Proud

Metal3 has evolved into so much more than a bare metal provisioning tool. We've
built a comprehensive platform that:

- Seamlessly integrates with Cluster API for Kubernetes lifecycle management
- Provides robust IP address management through our IPAM component
- Offers enterprise-grade security with automated vulnerability scanning
- Supports firmware management and day-2 operations
- Runs entirely on Kubernetes using native APIs

Our new Ironic Standalone Operator has revolutionized deployment simplicity,
making it easier than ever for teams to get started with Metal3.

## Looking Forward with Excitement

The roadmap ahead fills us with anticipation! In 2025, we're planning:

- Enhanced multi-tenancy support
- ARM architecture support beyond x86_64
- Improved DHCP-less provisioning capabilities
- New API revisions across our components
- Continued simplification of the user experience

## The Adventure Continues

Joining CNCF incubation isn't the end of our journey – it's an exciting new
chapter! With the foundation's support and our amazing community behind us,
we're more energized than ever to push the boundaries of what's possible with
bare metal Kubernetes infrastructure.

**Thank you** for being part of this incredible adventure. Here's to making bare
metal as cloud-native as the clouds themselves!
