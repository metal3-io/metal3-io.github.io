## Conference talk: Extend Your Data Center to the Hybrid Edge - Red Hat Summit, May 2019, Paul Cormier, Burr Stutter and Garima Sharma

A critical part of being successful in the hybrid cloud is being successful in your data centre with your own infrastructure.

In this video, Paul Cormier, Burr Sutter and Garima Sharma show how you can bring the Open Hybrid cloud to the edge. Cluster management from multiple cloud providers to on-premise. In the demo you'll see a multi-cluster inventory for the open hybrid cloud at cloud.redhat.com, OpenShift Container Storage providing storage for Virtual Machines and containers (Cloud, Virtualization and bare metal), and everything Kubernetes native.
