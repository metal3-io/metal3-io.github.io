## Conference talk: Open Infrastructure Days UK 2019; Kubernetes-native Infrastructure: Managed Baremetal with Kubernetes Operators and OpenStack Ironic - Steve Hardy, Red Hat

In this session you can hear about a new effort to enable baremetal Kubernetes deployments using native interfaces, and in particular the Kubernetes Operator framework, combined with OpenStack Ironic.

This approach aims to seamlessly integrate your infrastructure with your workloads, including baremetal servers, storage and container/VM workloads.  All this can be achieved using kubernetes native applications, combined with existing, proven deployment and storage tooling.

In this talk we cover the options around Kubernetes deployments today, the specific approach taken by the new Kubernetes-native "Metalkube" project, and the status/roadmap of this new community effort.


## Speakers
[Steve Hardy](http://hardysteven.blogspot.com) is Senior Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat, currently involved in kubernetes/OpenShift deployment and architecture. He is also an active member of the OpenStack community, and has been a project team lead of both the Heat (orchestration) and TripleO (deployment) projects.
